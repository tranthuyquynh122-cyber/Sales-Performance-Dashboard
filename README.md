## 🧠 Design Thinking Process  

This project applies a **Design Thinking approach** to ensure the dashboard solves real business problems and delivers actionable insights instead of only displaying metrics.

The process consists of four main stages:

1. Empathize  
2. Define (Point of View)  
3. Ideate  
4. Prototype & Review  

---

## 1️⃣ Empathize  

At this stage, we focus on understanding the stakeholder’s needs, goals, and challenges.

### 🎯 Target Stakeholder  
**Senior Manager / Business Leader**

### What the stakeholder wants:
- A quick and clear overview of overall business performance  
- Visibility into which markets and products drive revenue and profit  
- Early signals of risks such as declining margin or high return rates  
- Data-backed insights to support strategic decisions  

### What the stakeholder sees:
- Multiple markets and categories with different performance levels  
- Large volumes of raw data that are difficult to interpret  
- Performance changes across years  

### Pain Points:
- No single dashboard showing the full business picture  
- Hard to identify which markets or products should be prioritized  
- Difficult to compare performance across regions  
- Limited visibility into return rate impact  

### Gains (Expected Value):
- Clear understanding of business health  
- Easy identification of high-performing and underperforming areas  
- Faster and more confident decision-making  
- Actionable insights rather than raw numbers  

---

## 2️⃣ Define (Point of View)

### Problem Statement  

> Senior managers need a clear and intuitive dashboard that shows how sales and profit perform across markets and product categories, so they can prioritize investments, optimize resources, and improve overall business performance.

---

### Key Business Questions

- Which markets generate the highest sales and profit?  
- Which markets show strong growth potential?  
- Which product categories contribute most to revenue and profit?  
- Are there markets or products with low margins or high return rates?  
- Where should management focus next to drive growth?  

---

## 3️⃣ Ideate  

Based on the business questions, the following analytical directions were explored:

### Core Analytical Ideas

- Analyze sales, profit, and margin trends over time  
- Compare performance across markets and regions  
- Evaluate product categories and sub-categories  
- Identify high-growth vs low-performing segments

- Highlight opportunities and risks  

---

### Key Metrics Considered

## ⚒️ Main Process  

This section describes how the data was processed, analyzed, and transformed into meaningful dashboards.

---

## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Before analysis, the raw dataset was cleaned and structured to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Key data preparation steps:

- Removed invalid or missing records  
- Standardized date formats  
- Converted data types (numeric, date, text)  
- Created calculated columns where necessary  
- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- Ensured consistent category and market naming  
- Validated return flag values  

These steps help ensure reliable calculations and smooth performance in Power BI.

---

## 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand overall patterns before building dashboards.

### Key exploration areas:

- Distribution of total sales and profit  
- Trends over time (yearly performance)  
- Performance differences across markets  
- Product category contribution  
- Return rate behavior  

EDA helped identify early insights such as:
- Large variation in profitability between markets  
- Strong performance from a few key product categories  
- Potential risk areas with high return rates  

---

## 3️⃣ DAX Measures & Business Metrics  

Key business metrics were created using DAX to support analysis.

### Example DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Fact_Orders[Sales])

Total Profit = SUM(Fact_Orders[Profit])

Profit Margin =
DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

Total Orders =
DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact_Orders[Order ID])

Sales LY =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
)

Sales YoY % =
DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales LY], [Sales LY])

Return Rate =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Fact_Orders),
        Fact_Orders[Returned] = TRUE()
    ),
    COUNTROWS(Fact_Orders)
)
